# Mission Directive: 30-Day Cash Flow Sprint

**Objective:** Achieve "Cash Flow Positive" status within 30 days.
**Current Status:** $0 Revenue.
** Commander:** NK (User) -> Operations (Antigravity).

## The "Idea Clarity" Protocol
To ensure every idea is backed by data, we adhere to the **I.R.E.** Loop:

### 1. **I**nput (User Idea)
- User shares a concept, strategy, or target market.
- **Action:** Antigravity captures the core hypothesis.

### 2. **R**esearch (Validation)
- **Agent Action:** Activate `research-team`.
- **Tasks:**
    - Market Viability Analysis (Is there demand?).
    - Competitor Recon (Who else is doing it?).
    - Technical Feasibility (Can we build/offer it quickly?).
- **Output:** A "Research Brief" confirming if the idea is actionable or a distraction.

### 3. **E**xecution (Implementation)
- **Agent Action:** Activate `sales-team` or `engineering-team`.
- **Tasks:**
    - Update Notion (ClientOS / Project Board).
    - Generate Assets (Scripts, Code, Lists).
    - Launch.

## Departmental Orders
- **Research Team:** *Speed is key.* Don't write thesis papers. Give actionable "Yes/No" data.
- **Sales Team:** Focus on *Low Hanging Fruit*. Shortest path to $1.
- **Engineering Team:** Build only what sells. No "nice to haves".
